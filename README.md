Chris's SNP Genotyping Data
===========================

This repo contains raw genotype data, including data that is not used in 23andMe
reports. The data has undergone a general quality review however only a subset
of markers have been individually validated for accuracy. As such, the data is
suitable only for research, educational, and informational use and not for
medical or other use.

Fields are TAB-separated. Each line corresponds to a single SNP. For each SNP an
identifier is provided (an rsid or an internal id), it's location on the
reference human genome and the genotype call oriented with respect to the plus
strand on the human reference sequence. The data uses reference human assembly
build 37 (also known as Annotation Release 104). Note that it is possible that
data downloaded at different times may be different due to ongoing improvements
in the ability to call genotypes. More information about these changes can be
found at: https://you.23andme.com/p/e6d229ad665de68c/tools/data/download/
